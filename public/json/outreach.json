      "description":"15 8th grade students: The Small Satellite Research Laboratory hosted 16 eighth grade females from Madison County Middle School where they learned about CubeSats, soft circuits, 3D printing, and how to program micro controllers. Participants built their own 1U cardboard CubeSatâ€™s using materials acquired from NASA and they learned about other small satellites, the two missions at UGA, and the capabilities of the lab. During their tour of the lab the students were able to see our 3D printers in action, learn how they work, and got to take home one of the 3D printed objects. Students also learned about basic circuits and the emerging world of soft circuits. They designed and created bracelets that illuminated when attached to their wrists, allowing them to create their own personal designs while having to correctly sew/connect the different components of the circuit. The other project utilized LilyPad Arduino development boards, where they learned how to write code for the Arduino microprocessor. They programed the boards to play music, vibrate, make different LEDs flash, and even detect temperature. The students learned how to alter the programming of the Arduino so they could create their own projects after the workshop was completed.."
