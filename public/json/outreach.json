      "description":"15 8th grade students: The Small Satellite Research Laboratory hosted 16 eighth grade females from Madison County Middle School where they learned about CubeSats, soft circuits, 3D printing, and how to program micro controllers. Participants built their own 1U cardboard CubeSatâ€™s using materials acquired from NASA and they learned about other small satellites, the two missions at UGA, and the capabilities of the lab. During their tour of the lab the students were able to see our 3D printers in action, learn how they work, and got to take home one of the 3D printed objects. Students also learned about basic circuits and the emerging world of soft circuits. They designed and created bracelets that illuminated when attached to their wrists, allowing them to create their own personal designs while having to correctly sew/connect the different components of the circuit. The other project utilized LilyPad Arduino development boards, where they learned how to write code for the Arduino microprocessor. They programed the boards to play music, vibrate, make different LEDs flash, and even detect temperature. The students learned how to alter the programming of the Arduino so they could create their own projects after the workshop was completed.."

      "description":"200 kids and adults: The UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory hosted 3, 50 mintute workshops for the NSF Lisell-B family science day reaching iver 100 students. Megan Le Corre, Graham Grable, Adam king, and Godfrey Hendricks discussed space based science with parents and kids of all ages. The discused electronics involved in building satellities, capabilities of science that can be done from space and had demos the familys could interact with: 3-D printer, Arduino, Kerbal Space Program, and a model 3U CubeSat. For the 3-D printing demonstration, the students were shown in the lab how our 3-D printer operates. The Arduino station showed them how to code a sensor to put out a pitch that varies with distance and vary and LED's output. The Kerbal Space Program station taught the students the basics of rocket design and orbital mechanics."

SSSRL team members Megan Le Corre, Paige Copenhaver, and Graham Grable taught Kepler's Laws and Orbital Mechanics for the Advanced Physics Class at Cedar Shoals High School. 'Thank you so much for doing a presentation in my class on Keplers Laws and Orbital Mechanics. I dont know if you will ever know the deep impact you had on my students. You dispelled a lot of false beliefs about becoming a physics major and increased the possiblities of entertaining a major or a minor in physics; and also, career opportunities in the field. All my kids loved the lab that you brought and I learned a lot as well. I hope we can keep doing this every year. This is the best thing I could have ever doing for my kids. I thank you very much!!!!' Jackie Elder, science, Cedar Shoals High School."

      "description":"90 5th to 12th graders: The UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory hosted a total of 90 middle and high school age students in 3 one hour long sessions from June 26 through June 29. Four stations were present in which the students were able to interact with; 3-D printing, Arduino, Kerbal Space Program, and a drone demostration. For the 3-D printing demonstration, the students were shown in the lab how our 3-D printer operates. The Arduino station showed them how to code a sensor to put out a pitch that varies with distance. The Kerbal Space Program station taught the students the basics of rocket design and orbital mechanics. Finally the drone demonstation showed how an UAV worked without any operator input."
