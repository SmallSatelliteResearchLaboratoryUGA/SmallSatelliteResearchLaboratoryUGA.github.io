          <h2>(Spectral Ocean Color Satellite)</h2>
          <h1>Mission Overview</h1>
          <p>
            The SPectral Ocean Color (SPOC) satellite mission, was funded
            through NASA’s second iteration of the Undergraduate Student
            Instrument Project (USIP) in mid 2016. The SPOC's mission shall
            acquire moderate resolution imagery across a wide range of spectral
            bands to monitor coastal ecosystems and ocean color. SPOC will
            acquire image data between 433 and 866 nm to monitor 1) coastal
            wetlands status, 2) estuarine water quality including wetland
            biophysical characteristics and phytoplankton dynamics, and 3)
            near-coastal ocean productivity. SPOC shall use multispectral
            remote sensing techniques to quantify vegetation health, primary
            productivity, ocean productivity, suspended sediments, and organic
            matter in coastal regions. The uniqueness of SPOC lies in its
            payload, a 16 band adjustable multi spectral imager, called SPOC
            eye. The payload structure for SPOC was designed by Cloudland
            Instruments and the UGA SSRL SPOC team is actively building and
            refining the optical structure.
          </p>
          <h1>Current Status</h1>
          <p>
	    SPOC was succesfully integrated with NanoRacks on August 19 in Houston. It is scheduled for launch to the ISS on September 29th, 2020 from Wallops, VA. It is part of ELaNa 31 and will be launched onboard the Northrop Grumman Antares rocket (NG-14) as part of a Cygnus resupply mission.

Once onboard the ISS SPOC will be deployed into space sometime in late November using the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Robotic Manipulator System (JEMRMS). This robotic arm moves aims the satellite below the ISS and releases it.

          <h4>MOCI:</h4>
          <h2>(Multi-view On-board Computational Imager)</h2>
          <h1>Mission Overview</h1>
          <p>
            The Multi-view Onboard Computational Imager (MOCI) mission shall
            acquire imagery of the Earth’s surface from (Low Earth Orbit) LEO
            and perform near real time Structure from Motion (SfM) at a
            landscape scale using custom algorithms and off the shelf, high
            performance computational units. The MOCI mission will also
            identify and map coastal phenomena such as sediment plumes and
            algal blooms while training students in STEM related fields.
            Efficient data compression, feature detection, feature matching,
            and SfM processing techniques of space-based imagery will be
            performed on board the spacecraft as a proof-of-concept of high
            performance, on board processing capabilities. 3D models produced
            by the MOCI satellite will take the form of Digital Surface Models
            (DSM) as their end product for quick data downlink.
            <br><br>
            In early 2018 the student team in the UGA SSRL was selected as one
            of only two winners of the US Air Force Research Laboratory
            University Nanosatellite Program (Competition NS-9) Flight
            Selection Review for our MOCI (Multi-view Onboard Computational
            Imager) spacecraft. The team is now actively building MOCI and is
            in Phase B of the process.
          </p>
          <h1>Launch Information</h1>
          <p>
	    MOCI is currently in phase B of its construction with an expected delivery date of Q2 2021.

          <h2>(Mission for Education and Multimedia Engagement Satellite)</h2>
          <h1>Mission Overview</h1>
          <p>
            UGA is working with a local nonprofit, Let’s Go to Space, Inc.’s to build its first satellite mission, the Mission for Education and Multimedia Engagement. This spacecraft will be a 1U amateur radio CubeSat. It’s primary mission is to serve as an FM Repeater and to downlink donor submitted memes via UHF SSTV protocol. MEMESat is being created to engage people through outreach and help fund small satellite focused research. <br><br>
	    Nearly all systems will be custom build by UGA. Besides serving the greater outreach community this project will help our students hone their skills by allowing them to focus on building subsystems from the ground up.
