She is passionately interested in both science and literature. Some of her particular fascinations are astrophysics, cosmology, and speculative fiction. Her preferred career might include academic research, teaching, or working for NASA, possibly while writing sci-fi on the side. She plays rugby with the UGA Women's Rugby Football Club, where her responsibilities are more along the lines of knocking people over. She loves kombucha and Criminal Minds, and is powerless to resist a cat in need of attention.",
